A very simple math puzzle for those math nerds who are bored.

## Disclaimer
If you are so good in math and feel that the game is too easy. Feel free to build a library to make new problem using my app.


## Feature
The game will generate set of 3 problems. The user will either guess the number or operands required to match the equation. So far I have covered, addition, subtraction, multiple, division, modulo, log neutral, sin, cos, and tan.
